***BINLOG BROWSER V1.0****

@Author Rohit Kalhans

This project started as a hobby-project to leverage the BINLOG API
for viewing the events in the binlog file using a GUI.

The GUI is created using QT4.

BUILDING AND COMPILING 
======================

it is a two step process
0. Change the directory to the source directory 
1. cmake . or cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX='/path/to/install/directory/'
2. make install 

CLEANING UP
==========
use one of the two cleaning commands
1. make clean 
 this command cleans up the source of all the binaries and cmake files.
2. make disclean
  Cleans up the source code as it removes all the files which are not the part
  of source code distro.

ENJOY!
